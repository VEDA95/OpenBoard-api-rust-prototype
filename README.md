# OpenBoard REST API

The project contains the codebase for backend for the OpenBoard Kanboard web app. When looking for a self-hosted kanban boards I was dissatisfied by what options were available. So I decided I wanted to create a kanban board that I would want to use. With the following in mind, this project intends to provide a set of features and a user experience that will blow other solutions out of the water.

## Goals of this project
	- Self Hosted
        - Modular Design 
        - Excellent User Experience 
        - Mobile friendly (Something other solutions have had a hard time of implementing.)
        - Single Sign-On (Something many other solutions lacked)
