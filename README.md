# OpenBoard REST API

The project contains the codebase for backend for the OpenBoard Kanboard web app. When looking for a self-hosted kanban boards I was dissatisfied by what options were available. So I decided I wanted to create a kanban board that I would want to use. With the following in mind, this project intends to provide a set of features and a user experience that will blow other self-hosted solutions out of the water such as [Kanboard](https://kanboard.org/), [Taiga](https://taiga.io/), [Wekan](https://wekan.github.io/), and [Open Project](https://www.openproject.org/).

## Goals of this project
- Self Hosted
- Modular Design 
- Excellent User Experience 
- Mobile friendly (Something other solutions have had a hard time of implementing.)
- Single Sign-On (Something many other solutions lacked)
